Feature: Manage mad_libs

  Mad Libs are fun word games. You've probably played them at some point,
  if not, check out Wikipedia for more general information:
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs

  We'd like you to create an application that takes in a mad-lib
  definition, parses it, and then allows users to fill it in. The
  required syntax for a mad-lib is fairly simple, parts of speech
  that should be requested are surrounded by curly braces ('{' and
  '}').

  You should write sufficient code to pass these cucumber tests.
  Running the tests is as simple as running 'bundle exec rake cucumber'.

  Bonus points will be awarded for:
    * Passing more than the model-level Scenarios (remove the @wip tags)
    * Finding and using the helper tools we've included in this 
      application stub.
    * Deploying the resultant app on heroku or (for more points) 
      Amazon's EC2.
    * Making it look pretty
    * Making use of ajax (you may need to annotate these Scenarios with 
      the @javascript tag to make the features pass)
    * Anything else awesome above and beyond passing the tests

  Feel free to ask questions, especially related to getting your
  environment set up. Questions about implementation may not
  necessarily be answered ;) Just email josh@optoro.com

  Good luck!

  Scenario: Create a madlib model
    When I create a madlib with the text:
      """
      I {verb, past-tense} the {noun}. It was {adjective}.
      """
    Then it should have the following fields:
      | label                 |
      | Verb, past-tense (1): |
      | Noun (1):             |
      | Adjective (1):        |
    When I assign the fields these values:
      | label                 | value    |
      | Verb, past-tense (1): | walked   |
      | Noun (1):             | dog      |
      | Adjective (1):        | exciting |
    Then the madlib should resolve to:
      """

  Scenario: create a complicated madlib model
    When I create a madlib with the text:

You try to {verb} {adjective} requirements and find a way of expressing them so that a mere {noun} can do them justice.
